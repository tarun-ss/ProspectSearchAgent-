# Prospect Finder AI ü§ñ

Prospect Finder AI is a modern web application that leverages the power of the Google Gemini API to act as an autonomous B2B Prospect Search Agent. It takes a user-defined Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and generates a list of matching companies and key contacts, complete with a confidence score.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This application is built as a self-contained frontend application using React and TypeScript. Instead of manually integrating with multiple external APIs (like Apollo, Crunchbase, etc.), it uses a sophisticated AI-first approach.

1.  **ICP Input**: The user provides an Ideal Customer Profile in a JSON format. This defines the criteria for the prospect search, such as industry, company size, revenue, and required technologies.

2.  **AI as the Agent**: The application sends the ICP to the **Google Gemini API** with a detailed set of instructions. This prompt transforms the AI into a specialized "Prospect Search Agent".

3.  **Simulated Workflow**: The AI executes a simulated workflow based on the instructions:
    *   **Query**: It simulates querying multiple data sources (like Apollo, Crunchbase, and SerpAPI) to gather firmographic data, contact information, and buying signals.
    *   **Merge & Deduplicate**: It combines the information from these virtual sources, removing duplicate companies and contacts to create an enriched profile.
    *   **Score**: It calculates a `confidence` score for each prospect using a specific heuristic formula (`score = 0.4*industry_match + 0.3*funding_signal + 0.2*hiring_signal + 0.1*tech_match`), ensuring the results are ranked by relevance.

4.  **Structured JSON Output**: To ensure reliability and prevent errors, the application instructs the Gemini API to return its findings in a strict JSON format using a predefined `responseSchema`.

5.  **Display Results**: The React frontend receives the clean JSON data, manages the loading and error states, and dynamically renders the list of prospects in a clean, user-friendly interface.
